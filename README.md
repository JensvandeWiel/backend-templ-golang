# Backend template golang
Just a small low boilerplate example to quickly start a backend project in golang.

## Why?
I've seen templates with a lot of boilerplate code, and I wanted to create a template with the minimum boilerplate code possible to create a quick app.

## Features
- Low profile MVC architecture
- Easily extendable/modifiable
- Simple and easy to understand

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute to this project, I'll be happy to see your pull requests and if they feel right for the template ill merge them!
